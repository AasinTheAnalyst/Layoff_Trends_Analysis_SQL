# SQL-Data-Cleaning-and-EDA-Project
Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis using MySQL on [layoffs.csv]

## Project Overview
This project focuses on data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) using the **World Layoffs Dataset** (2020-2023). The dataset contains global layoff records from various companies.

## Files in Repository
- `layoffs.csv` - The raw dataset.
- `Data Cleaning.sql` - SQL queries for cleaning the dataset.
- `EDA.sql` - SQL queries for exploratory data analysis.

## Dataset Source
The dataset includes information on layoffs from different industries and countries between 2020 and 2023.

## How to Use
1. Load the `layoff.csv` dataset into your SQL database.
2. Run the `Data Cleaning.sql` script to preprocess the data.
3. Use the `EDA.sql` script to generate insights from the cleaned dataset.

## Tools & Techniques Used
- SQL (MySQL)
- Data Cleaning techniques
